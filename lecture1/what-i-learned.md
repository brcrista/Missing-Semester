- `cd -` returns to the previous directory.
- Ctrl+l works the same as `clear`
- On macOS, Cmd+Tab switches between applications, and Cmd+\` switches between windows of an application.
- File permissions:
    - See with `ls -l`
    - Three groups of three bits: `rwx` (read, write, execute)
    - First group: owner
    - For directories: "read" means list contents, "write" means change contents, "execute" means `cd` into the directory
        - You can't delete a file unless you have the `w` bit on the directory
- Command-line arguments, `stdin`, and `stdout`
    - `echo` sends its arguments to `stdout`
    - `cat` sends `stdin` to `stdout`
    - `tee` sends `stdin` to both a file and `stdout`
    - `>` sends `stdout` to a file
    - `<` sends a file to `stdin`
    - `|` sends `stdout` to `stdin`
- The `$` prompt means you are in a user shell. The `#` prompt means you are in a root shell.
    - `root` is a special user that can do anything (passes any permissions check).
    - You can use `sudo su` to get a root shell, though this is dangerous and not recommended.
    - Note that commands like `sudo echo hello > /some/protected/file` won't work if you don't have write permission!
        - You need to do `echo hello | sudo tee /some/protected/file` 
- On Linux, the `sys` directory contains files for device drivers.
    - You can manipulate some settings, such as screen brightness, by editing these files.
    - Unix philosophy: "everything is a file." This is nice because you can work with these files using shell commands like anything else.
